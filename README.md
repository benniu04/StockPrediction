# StockPrediction

## Overview

This project is a Stock Price Prediction and Trading Automation System that combines machine learning models with real-time stock trading via the Alpaca API. The system predicts stock price direction for the next dayâ€™s market open and can automatically execute buy or sell trades based on those predictions.

The pipeline leverages historical stock data, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators to make informed trading decisions.
